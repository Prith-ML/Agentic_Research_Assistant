# Agentic Research Assistant 
The Agentic Research Assistant is built as a multi‐stage pipeline that turns your free‐form query into a targeted research session. Rather than presenting raw search results, it drives a sequence of classification, retrieval, synthesis, and suggestion steps—each implemented as a modular “tool” that can be independently tested, replaced, or extended. Under the hood, it uses vector embeddings, a remote index service, and an LLM orchestrator to keep everything decoupled yet smoothly integrated.
